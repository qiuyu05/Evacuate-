Your current WALLS_RAW has incorrect data.

The working code you provided has completely different wall coordinates that properly align with the rooms.

To fix:
1. Replace your WALLS_RAW with the correct data from your working code
2. Remove the separate txWall/tyWall transforms
3. Remove the wallOffsetX/wallOffsetY calibration UI
4. Use the same tx/ty transform for both walls and rooms

The walls in your working code start with coordinates like:
[[856,786,856,882],[856,882,856,786],[862,914,862,968]...]

But your current app has:
[[851,1244,949,1244],[852,204,949,204],[853,755,996,755]...]

These are completely different coordinate sets! That's why they don't align.
